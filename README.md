# Used-Cars
In this project, exploratory data analysis was performed to find various characteristics about used cars like :
1) Are there any missing values in the car price and age dataset? How should these missing values be handled?
2) How many unique vehicle types are present in the dataset?
3) Can we create visualizations to understand the relationship between car age and prices using scatter plots or other suitable visualizations?

Created a linear regression model to analyze the relationship between car prices and age (year of registration) to suggest which cars provide the best value for money.
